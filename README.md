# Strava Project


## Project Background and Goal

As a long-dinstance runner, I'm always on the lookout for new ways to optimize my performance. Fortunately, there are a bevy of wearable devices that can give us users insight into some key data points like:

* miles per week
* heart rate
* effort

Now, as a (wannabe) data engineer, I'm looking to create a data flow to ultimately render some of these metrics in a webpage (and possibly uncover some previously unknown information about my own athletic performance and health). I also hope to gain some more hands-on experience leveraging the different technologies used in this data flow. The project architecture is described below. 


## Project Structure

Let's do some more research before nailing this down.
